# UKG Rest Client

## Developer's disclosure

I need to demonstrate my skills as a software developer with skills for software integration by consuming external web services, specifically the ones hosted by Ultimate Kronos Group (UKG). UKG is a provider of cloud based workforce management software. UKG's developer portal and the web services are accessible only to customers. So, I asked Amazon Q to generate mock web services based on the API specification that is publicly available at https://doc.people-doc.com/client/api/index-v2.html. 

The code at the root of the repository was implemented by me. 

The code in the mock_ukg_rest directory in this repository was generated by Amazon Q.
