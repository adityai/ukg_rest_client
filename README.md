# UKG Rest Client

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/adityai/ukg_rest_client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/adityai/ukg_rest_client)

## Developer's disclosure

I need to demonstrate my skills as a software developer with skills for software integration by consuming external web services, specifically the ones hosted by Ultimate Kronos Group (UKG). UKG is a provider of cloud based workforce management software. UKG's developer portal and the web services are accessible only to customers. So, I asked Amazon Q to generate mock web services based on the API specification that is publicly available at https://doc.people-doc.com/client/api/index-v2.html. 

The code at the root of the repository was implemented by me. 

The code in the mock_ukg_rest directory in this repository was generated by Amazon Q. Additionally, test_ukg_api_client_pytest.py was generated by Amazon Q.

## Additional list of implemented features
- Unit tests 
- Packaging rest client as a python module
- Circleci build that runs unit tests and packages the rest client as a python module

## Run the mock server

```
cd mock_ukg_rest
pip install -r requirements.txt
python mock_server.py
```

## Run the client

```
cd ..
pip install -r requirements.txt
export UKG_APP_ID="test_app"
export UKG_APP_SECRET="test_secret"
export UKG_CLIENT_ID="test_client"
export UKG_COMPANY_SHORT_NAME="your_company_short_name"
export UKG_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
python ukg_api_client.py
```
